                                        A poorly designed IT network can cost you precious dollars that could otherwise be
                                        used to stimulate business growth. The importance of utilizing experienced network
                                        technicians with knowledge in the design of effiecient networks is imperative to a
                                        healthy, growing firm. Whether you are opening up a new local business location,
                                        expanding your current facilities, or just redesigning an out of date existing network,
                                        our team of engineers can meet with you at your location and show you how a correctly
                                        designed network can save you time and money. Many networks are unnecessarily and overly
                                        complicated and do not include the proper redundancy and high-availability.
                                        A overly complicated network increases costs and potential failure downtime.

                                        When looking at IT service and managed service providers one must understand that
                                        systems do not run themselves. Backups must be monitored, storage must be reviewed
                                        and security must be analyzed. Simply letting your systems go will, contrary to many,
                                        not save you money. Here is an example, let’s say you had an IT provider come and setup
                                        new servers and workstations in January. You never entered into any contracts and the IT
                                        provider simply installed the equipment and went on his way. Well, one night your
                                        network attached storage for backups throws a RAID failure. You don’t know what that
                                        is nor were you notified and as a result you simply continue on your way. As time goes
                                        a second drive fails in the array. Meanwhile, everything else is working like you think
                                        it should. Fast-forward a week and a user downloads a virus due to a non-centrally managed
                                        AV that wasn’t properly updated and it just so happens this virus spread due to a Windows
                                        exploit that was not properly patched. You scramble to figure out what to do and you start
                                        making phone calls. One of those calls might be to us. (We’ve been in this situation many times).
                                        We get onsite and you ask us to restore the corrupted files from the backup. We logon to the server
                                        and explain that no backups have been done in 4 weeks. You think, that’s impossible, everything has
                                        been running. Now you sit there with 4 weeks worth of lost work. Question, how much does that cost
                                        your business?

                                        A poorly designed IT network can cost you precious dollars that could otherwise be used to stimulate business growth.
                                        The importance of utilizing experienced network technicians with knowledge in the design of effiecient networks is
                                        imperative to a healthy, growing firm. Whether you are opening up a new local business location, expanding your

                                        at your location and show you how a correctly designed network can save you time and money. Many networks are
                                        unnecessarily and overly complicated and do not include the proper redundancy and high-availability.
                                        A overly complicated network increases costs and potential failure downtime.

                                        new business, network design is one of the first things you should address in your IT
                                        “to do” list. From an operational as well as compliance standpoint, it is critical
                                        to build your business on a secure, reliable network foundation, while integrating
                                        the flexibility and scalability you need to smoothly manage business growth.

                                        Do you desire enterprise grade quality and features at small-business costs?
                                        Well look no further than a hosted cloud-PBX system. The days of purchasing
                                        expensive in-house PBX phone systems is coming to a close. As DOCSIS 3.0 speeds go
                                        over 100mbps and fiber being more readily available reliable cloud-PBX solutions
                                        are becoming the norm in telephony upgrades.

                                        Our hosted cloud-based PBX solution is excellent for small, medium and large
                                        enterprises as well as call centers. You can add our VoIP services to the mix,
                                        or use different providers. All this is available as a managed, cloud hosted PBX.
                                        We offer all this without the hefty capital investment of a typical on-site PBX.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Businesses across the country continue their march towards full adoption of cloud
                                        services enabling them to reduce technology expenses, increase efficiencies, boost
                                        productivity and always have the latest software to power their business.
                                        Hosted-PBX is definitely the future but not all providers are the same.
